WITHOUT SPEEDBOOSTER:
=====================

Original Crop factor: 36mm (FF) / 18.96mm (4K MFT) =  1.8987 (FF sensor width divided by MFT width)
Equivalent focal length in Full Frame: 35mm x 1.8987 = 66.4545mm
Equivalent aperture in Full Frame: 1.4 x 1.8987 = f 2.6581 (DoF)

WITH SPEEDBOOSTER:
=====================

1.8987 (Original crop factor) x 0.71 (speedbooster factor) = 1.3480 (resulting crop factor)  
Equivalent focal length in FF: 35mm (Lens Focal length) x 1.3480 = 47.1826mm 
Equivalent aperture in FF: 1.4 x 1.8987 x 0.71 = f 1.8873 (DoF)

Speedbooster (Viltrox EF-M2 II 0.71x):

PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION IN AFTER EFFECTS
=========================================

After many hours of calculations and research, I have found the issues with our calculations regarding the AE camera settings.

The Speedboosters do not change the effective sensor area and actual focal length in real life, but increase ONLY the angle of view (aka FOV) and the light entering the sensor, effectively increasing the f-stop. So we do not divide the diagonal by the crop factor.

That's why we say that the 35mm Full Frame lens in MFT sensor comes closer to a Full Frame sensor angle of view and behaves better with night scenes. The Speedbooster reacts only to DoF and light entering the sensor, not actual Focal length. (AE camera is agnostic of such terms and cares only about Angle of View and sensor dimensions)

That means we have to change the default Film size value, and use the actual diagonal measure of the BMPCC 4K sensor size which is 21,44 mm with accurate measurements. And IT HAS to be diagonal, since it has a custom size to be more accurate.

The focal length should stay locked at 35mm in AE camera (the physical focal length of the lens used in FF) if we want to simulate a prime lens and not a parfocal zoom lens. Here is the point where the Zoom setting has to be taken into account, since it is always tied to AE camera's Focal Length. We need Focal Length locked to 35mm to replicate prime lens, so we should NOT change the Zoom setting.

We SHOULD however decouple the Focus distance from the Zoom setting and simulate a real focus ring. However, we have to always keyframe the focus distance of the Z axis to the subject we want to focus on, along with the camera position, like we do in real life. After Effects has something similar like "Set focus distance to layer" but does not work in our case.

Moving forward, here is the point where the other AE camera options need to be addressed (Blur, Aperture and F-Stop). The aperture setting is tied to F-Stop (makes sense). If we assign F-Stop value to 1, the aperture becomes 35 mm. The same way if we increase to F-Stop = 5 the aperture becomes 7mm (5x7=35). So it behaves like a multiplier but not quite.

To calculate in real life an f-stop, we divide the lens focal length by the diameter of the effective aperture (the opening in the lens as measured with a ruler from the mount of the lens). The formula is: f-stop = Focal Length / Aperture Diameter. In our case I measured slightly lower than 2 centimeters by eye. 

HERE COMES THE EYE OPENING PART! If we add the value of the minimum equivalent f-stop value of the actual lens in Full Frame with the Speedbooster attached (needed since it increases and lowers the value of f-stops) we have:

f-stop = 35 mm / 1,8873 = 18,5450

This is what the AE camera window exactly shows as well for the aperture value in milimeters!! Odd, but it works. Hooray!! This means that we can go as low as f 1,8873 maximum to replicate the lens behavior. Then we should set the blur setting as a static value with each shot, preferably matching the physical lens blur amount on that moment. The f-stop setting can be dependent on the DoF of the actual scene in real life if we want to integrate the VFX scene to the shot and can be changed accordingly with the aperture setting later in the layer. Since here we have a simulation at an astronomical scale observed by Earth, we should replicate the "Focus to Infinity" term in photography where everything on the plane stay sharp. This can ONLY be possible in AE camera by setting the aperture setting to 0 pixel value in camera options dropdown menu.

I played further with the f-stop setting and I found out that in the first initial camera window setup, as I increase the f-stop, the AE camera iris ring opens, while it is the REVERSE in real life! The iris should close to reduce the light coming in and effectively widen the DoF, but this might be the way it is coded. In any case we will set manually the aperture to 52,5685 pixels everytime we want the DoF of the BMPCC 4K or play with the pixel value of aperture as discussed earlier in the camera option in the layer.

The most interesting part is that the AE camera after you adjust the main pop-up window values, shows every value in pixels at the layer level in "Camera Options" dropdown menu. 

We HAVE to set also the Focus Distance value to 1920 pixels manually, since the Sun is placed in the center of the composition. This way I have razor sharp focus there (1920,0 , 1080,0 , 0,0). 

Now, let's say we are crazy and want to change the focus to the Moon while staying static or orbiting, and we have DoF enabled by increasing the aperture. The Moon is placed at 1600,0 , 1080,0 , -1920,0 in the XYZ axis. We should then change the focus distance to the value of the Focus Distance to 1280,0 pixels. I don't know the math behind it however. It was difficult to calculate it when every XYZ value changes.

We can set up interesting focus transitions and orbits while focusing on different points, by keyframing them in the timeline this way. We can replicate for example a cameraman using the focus ring to focus between two people having a conversation during time and manipulate the "agressiveness" of the focus pull.

FINAL CAMERA SETTINGS FOR AE:

Film Size: 21,44 mm (Actual Blackmagic MFT diagonal)
Measure Film Size: Diagonally
Focal Length: 35 mm
Zoom: 2537,29 mm (In the layer settings has the initial value of 7192,3275 pixels)
Initial Focus distance: 2537,29 mm (Decoupled from Zoom. Aperture value is changed later to 1920 pixels in the camera layer settings, which is the center of the Z axis in a 4K composition)
Aperture: 18,55 mm (Shown as 52,6 pixels in camera layer settings)
F-Stop: 1,8873
Blur level: 100% (Depending on each scene)
Resulting Angle of View: 34,06°

The resulting Angle of View matches my physical camera behavior, since I have a narrower FoV than the Full Frame 35mm equivalent and behaves closer to a 50mm FF lens due to the crop factor of x1.3480 with the Speedbooster (Previously measured as 47.1826 mm FF equivalent with Speedbooster attached).

Now all I need to do is to place both of celestial bodies on the back of the Z visible axis from the top view. Let's say at 750. Now the XYZ coordinates become like this:

Sun: (1920,0 , 1080,0 , 750,0)
Moon: (1920,0 , 1080,0 , -750,0)
Center of composition: (1920,0 , 1080,0 , 0,0)

Now we have to scale down the Moon to match the 102.9% of the Sun disc during the eclipse. The resulting scale of Moon is 387,933% of the default 500%. The Sun stays at 500%, but we have brought further front to the camera the Moon so it is close to the 102.9% ratio. The percentage is calculated by the XYZ values
