Calculations were done with a 2000 px wide Sun in mind.
If the Sun is not 2000 px multiply the parameters by:

 ----------------------------
|S = (sun_diameter_px / 2000)|
 ----------------------------

Our Sun measured diameter is = 960 px

So:
---
S = 960 px / 2000 = x0.48 (factor)

|“Viscosity” & eruption keyframe timing|
 ------------------------------------

Block A — Quiet build (Frames 0–200)
--------------------------------
Birth Rate: 80 → 150 (ease in)
Fluid Viscosity: 45% (stable, sticky)
Emitter Velocity: 120



Block B — Trigger (Frames 200–260, i.e., 2.4 s)
----------------------------------------
Birth Rate: 150 → 1000 (sharp ease)
Emitter Velocity: 120 → 520
Fluid Viscosity: 45% → 18% (drop = plasma “breaks loose”)
Turbulence Field → Affect Position: 55 → 65 (adds tearing)



Block C — Peak ejection (Frames 260–500)
-------------------------------------
Birth Rate: 1000 → 1200 (short plateau 260–340, then taper)
Emitter Velocity: 520 (hold)
Fluid Viscosity: 18% → 28% (slow rise)
Aux Emit Probability: 35% → 50% (more fine spray)



Block D — Magnetic re-closure / loop fallback (Frames 500–1100)
---------------------------------------------------------
Birth Rate: 1200 → 300
Emitter Velocity: 520 → 220
Fluid Viscosity: 28% → 52% (eddy damping now dominates)
Turbulence Field → Flow: 0.3 → 0.15 (eddies calm; strands settle)



Block E — Decay (Frames 1100–2000)
-------------------------------
Birth Rate: 300 → 60
Emitter Velocity: 220 → 80
Fluid Viscosity: 52% → 60%
Aux Emit Probability: 50% → 15%



Low viscosity during the impulsive phase (high Re → long coherent filaments), then rising viscosity & reduced turbulence to damp structures as they settle into loop-like arches—consistent with turbulent/eddy dissipation dominating over molecular viscosity.



TIME HANDLE
-----------
If we want slower motion (say ×60 instead of ×120), we chave to reduce Emitter Velocity by 0.5× and Fluid Viscosity by ~−5 to −8 pp across the board (keeping the same envelope). This keeps the flow similarly turbulent (qualitatively same Re regime) but plays slower.
