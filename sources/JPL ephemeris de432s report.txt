=== Recommendation for CSV->AE mapping ===
Composition width used for recommendation: 4096.0 px
baseline_sensorToComp (comp_px per sensor_px) = comp_width / sensor_pixels = 1.000000
Desired screen coverage fraction = 0.600 (0..1)
Allowed half-comp px = 1228.800 px
Computed recommended posMultiplier (unclamped) = 16.477994
Recommended posMultiplier (clamped to [0.050000, 10.000000]) = 10.000000
â†’ Use this value for `posMultiplier` in your JSX (or set posMultiplier = 0 in JSX and let it auto-calc from sensor_pixels and comp width).

=== Scientific / modelling notes ===
- Using topocentric AltAz from Astropy: parallax and correct observer geometry included.
- Distances taken from astropy cartesian vectors; angular sizes derived via simple geometry (diameter/distance).
- Ephemeris: de432s used if available (high-precision).
- Limitations: no atmospheric refraction correction applied; limb darkening and eclipse penumbra/umbra ground-track are NOT modelled here.
- For VFX this approach is usually sufficient: it matches apparent positions and apparent angular sizes within arc-second-level ephemeris accuracy.
- If you need sub-arcsecond or ground-track accuracy, you should use full NAIF/SPICE tools and site-specific corrections.

=== How to use ===
1) Put the generated CSV into the JSX importer you use.
2) In the JSX, either keep posMultiplier=0 (auto) or set posMultiplier to the recommended value above.
3) If Moon/Sun still look out of range, increase comp_width_pixels in this script to match your AE comp width and re-run to get a new recommendation.
4) If you want a world-scale mapping (1 AE px = 1 km), you can also set posMultiplier manually such that 1 AE px corresponds to the chosen km-per-px mapping (but this often produces very large numeric Z/POI values in AE).
